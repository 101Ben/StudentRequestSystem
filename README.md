# Student Request System

The Student Request System is a prototype designed for the North Seattle College Tutoring center. 
With this App, students will instead be using their phone (Android) to request the assistance 
of a tutor. In the actual System, they are required to log in using a computer or any navigator. 

This project was held as part of the projects for the Application Development Club at North Seattle
College (2018-2019) 
Club was created by a group of classmates supported by our school faculty. The initial goal has been
to get hand on the application of the Java concepts learn in class in the real world.
